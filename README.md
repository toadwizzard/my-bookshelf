# MyBookshelf
A website for keeping track of books you own, lent, or wish to own some day.

The site is available on [Github Pages](https://toadwizzard.github.io/my-bookshelf/).

## Development notes
The website is currently under development, and currently has no supporting backend for data persistence. Example data is available for demonstrative purposes with username "user" and password "password" (or data can be temporarily added via registering).
