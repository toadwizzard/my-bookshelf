# MyBookshelf
A website for keeping track of books you own, lent, or wish to own some day.

The site is available on [Github Pages](https://toadwizzard.github.io/my-bookshelf/).

## Features
A personal bookshelf to showcase all owned books, with various options to search, sort and filter between books.

A separate wishlist bookshelf, with similar search and filter functioning, and the option to remove a book from the list and add it to the owned books.

Books on the personal shelf can be lent out to other people by (optionally) adding the borrower's name and date of lending, helping keep track of books the user owns but are currently in someone else's possession. Books can also be marked as borrowed from someone else or a library.
